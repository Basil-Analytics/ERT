#' An interactive function to fix the overlap between episodes of democratization and autocratization.
#'
#' @param episodes The outcome of get_eps(), episodes of regime transformation (ERT), to be used for fixing potential overlaps (depending on individual parameter setting). By default with standard parameters.
#'
#' @param overlap The outcome of find_overlap(merged), depending on individual parameter settings.
#'
#' @return A "merged" dataframe after recoding overlapping episodes based on the interactive function.
