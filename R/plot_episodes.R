#' Plot Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT) over time.
#'
#' `plot_episodes` plots Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT) over time. It shows either
#' the global number/share of countries undergoing democratization and autocratization or
#' episodes for an individual country.
#'
#' This function is a wrapper for [ggplot2:ggplot()] and produces a plot that shows
#' democratization and autocratization episodes over time.
#' Either the global number/share of countries undergoing democratization and autocratization or
#' episodes for an individual country are plotted. The function calls the [ERT:get_eps()] funtion that is
#' used to identify episodes.
#'
#' @param abs Logical value: if TRUE, the absolute number of countries in an episode for each year is plotted. If FALSE, the share
#'  of countries (in \%) undergoing democratization or autocratization is plotted.
#'
#' @param years Vector with numeric values indicating the minimum and maximum year to be plotted.
#'
#' @param country Character vector containing the country for which episodes should be shown. Only countries from the
#'  country_name column in the V-Dem data set are accepted. If no countries are specified, global episode numbers
#'  are plotted. Only a single country can be selected.
#'
#' @param start_incl What is the minimum annual change on V-Dem's Electoral Democracy Index (EDI) necessary to trigger an episode? 
#' This is the absolute value of the first difference in the EDI required for the onset 
#' of either a democratization (+) or autocratization episode (â€“).
#'
#' @param cum_incl What is the minimum amount of total change on the EDI necessary to constitute a manifest episode?
#' A potential episode might be a period involving any amount of changes over a period following an annual change equal 
#' to the start inclusion (e.g. 0.01). To identify substantial changes, we set a cumulative inclusion threshold. 
#' This is the absolute value of the total amount of change needed on the EDI to be considered manifest.
#'
#' @param year_turn What is the amount of annual change in the opposite direction to trigger the termination of an episode? 
#' An episode may end when the case suddenly moves in the opposite direction. 
#' For example, during an episode of democratization, a country may experience a sudden drop on the EDI. 
#' This could signal the onset of an autocratization episode. To avoid overlap between episodes, 
#' we set the absolute value of a change in the opposite direction on the EDI 
#' as a trigger for the termination of an episode. \emph{Note: Advanced users who wish to remove this criteria altogether 
#' should set the value of year\_turn equal to cum\_turn. 
#' Setting this to zero would allow for an episode to terminate when any year of no change is encountered.}
#' 
#' @param cum_turn What is the amount of gradual change in the opposite direction to trigger the termination of an episode?
#' An episode may end when the case begins moving in the opposite direction gradually. For example, 
#' during an episode of democratization, a country may experience a gradual drop on the EDI over a number of years 
#' that signals democratization has ended. This could also signal the onset of an autocratization episode. 
#' To avoid overlap between episodes, we set the absolute value of a gradual change in the opposite direction 
#' on the EDI over the tolerance period (e.g. 5 years) as a trigger for the termination of an episode.
#'
#' @param tolerance What is the number of years considered as tolerance for stasis or a gradual movement in the opposite direction?
#' The tolerance defines the number of years an episode is allowed to remain in stasis 
#' (i.e. no more movements equal to the start inclusion) and/or move in the opposite direction before it is terminated. 
#' This parameter also defines the number of years necessary for a case to be considered a democratic breakdown or 
#' stabilized electoral autocracy. \emph{Therefore, care is necessary when manipulating the default value. 
#' This could lead to large changes in the composition of episodes. 
#' We set the default to 5 years because this is the typical amount for an electoral cycle for most countries.}
#'
#' @return The output of this function is a [ggplot2:ggplot()] object with global or country-specific episodes.
