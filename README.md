# Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT) dataset 

#### NOTE: we provide here mainly for non-R users the ERT dataset as csv. file (download the repository including the codebook by clicking the green clone or download button) - however, we recommend using our [vdemdata R package](https://github.com/vdeminstitute/vdemdata) since one huge advantage of the package is that it allows to flexibly set parameters for generating the ERT dataset.

#### For details see the attached ERT Codebook.



## V-Dem: Global Standards, Local Knowledge ##

Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) is a new approach to conceptualizing and measuring democracy. We provide a multidimensional and disaggregated dataset that reflects the complexity of the concept of democracy as a system of rule that goes beyond the simple presence of elections. The V-Dem project distinguishes between five high-level principles of democracy: electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian, and collects data to measure these principles. 

We are a team of over 50 social scientists on six continents. We work with more than 3,000 country experts and a truly global International Advisory Board. [Read more about the work we do here](https://www.v-dem.net/en/).
